## Overview
This is a game where the user tries to guess what the computer is thinking. It was a simple way to introduce javascript with HTML and CSS. 

## Demo

1. To start the game the user must press any key between A-Z.

2. Once a key is pressed the user's guesses are recorded and shown on the screen so they know what they have pressed.

3. If they guess the wrong letter they get 8 guesses before one is added to their losses.

4. If they guess the right letter their score goes up by one and the list of your guesses is reset.
